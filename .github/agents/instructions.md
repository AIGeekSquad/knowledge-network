# Copilot Agent Instructions for Knowledge Network

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript monorepo for `@aigeeksquad/knowledge-network`, a library extending d3.js for creating interactive knowledge graph visualizations. The project uses pnpm workspaces for monorepo management.

## Package Manager

This project uses **pnpm 8+** as the package manager. Always use `pnpm` commands, never `npm` or `yarn`.

## Common Commands

### Installation
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Building
```bash
# Build all packages (except examples)
pnpm build

# Build in watch mode
cd packages/knowledge-network && pnpm dev
```

The library is built using [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/), which generates:
- ESM output (`dist/index.js`)
- CJS output (`dist/index.cjs`)
- TypeScript declarations (`dist/index.d.ts`, `dist/index.d.cts`)

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
cd packages/knowledge-network && pnpm test:watch
```

Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with jsdom environment for DOM testing.

### Linting and Formatting
```bash
# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Format code with Prettier
pnpm format
```

Linting uses ESLint with TypeScript support. Current warnings about `any` types are known and non-blocking.

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start examples in development mode
pnpm dev
```

## Development Guidelines

### When Making Changes

1. **Install dependencies first**: Always run `pnpm install` after cloning or when dependencies change
2. **Build before testing**: Run `pnpm build` to ensure the library is compiled
3. **Test your changes**: Run `pnpm test` to verify tests pass
4. **Lint your code**: Run `pnpm lint` to check for code style issues
5. **Run examples**: Use `pnpm dev` to visually verify changes in the examples

### Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Use d3-idiomatic patterns (accessor functions that can be values or functions)
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Keep tests colocated in `__tests__/` directories
- Follow existing naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for functions/variables)

### Testing

- Tests are located in `packages/knowledge-network/src/__tests__/`
- Use Vitest for unit tests
- Mock DOM elements when testing visualization components
- Test both static values and accessor functions for d3-idiomatic APIs

## MCP Server Usage

### DeepWiki MCP Server

Use the DeepWiki MCP server to:
- **Understand dependencies**: Query documentation for d3.js, TypeScript, Vitest, and other dependencies
- **Learn library APIs**: Get information about d3 force simulation, selection APIs, and other d3 modules
- **Reference examples**: Find usage patterns for dependencies

Example queries:
- "How does d3.forceSimulation work?"
- "What are the d3 selection methods for DOM manipulation?"
- "How to use Vitest for testing TypeScript code?"

### SonarQube MCP Server

Use the SonarQube MCP server to:
- **Check code quality**: Analyze code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells
- **Review code coverage**: Ensure tests cover critical code paths
- **Maintain quality gates**: Verify code meets project quality standards
- **Fix issues**: Address SonarQube findings before committing

Always run SonarQube analysis after making significant changes to ensure code quality.

## Key Dependencies

- **d3** (^7.0.0): Peer dependency for visualization (not bundled)
- **TypeScript** (^5.7.2): Language and type checking
- **tsup** (^8.3.5): Build tool for library bundling
- **Vitest** (^2.1.9): Testing framework
- **ESLint** (^9.18.0): Linting with TypeScript support

## Important Notes

### Monorepo Workspace

This is a pnpm workspace with multiple packages:
- Use `pnpm --recursive` or `pnpm -r` for workspace-wide commands
- The root `package.json` defines workspace scripts
- Each package has its own `package.json` and can be built independently

### Build Output

- The `dist/` directory is gitignored and generated by the build process
- Never commit build artifacts
- Always build before publishing or testing

### Known Linting Warnings

The codebase has known ESLint warnings about `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` (29 warnings). These are accepted technical debt related to d3 typings and don't block development.

## Contributing

When making changes:
1. Fork and create a feature branch
2. Make minimal, focused changes
3. Add tests for new features
4. Ensure all tests pass: `pnpm test`
5. Ensure code is linted: `pnpm lint`
6. Update documentation if needed
